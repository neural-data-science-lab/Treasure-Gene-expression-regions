abstract = {In this work, we are interested in generalizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) from low-dimensional regular grids, where image, video and speech are represented, to high-dimensional irregular domains, such as social networks, brain connectomes or words' embedding, represented by graphs. We present a formulation of CNNs in the context of spectral graph theory, which provides the necessary mathematical background and efficient numerical schemes to design fast localized convolutional filters on graphs. Importantly, the proposed technique offers the same linear computational complexity and constant learning complexity as classical CNNs, while being universal to any graph structure. Experiments on MNIST and 20NEWS demonstrate the ability of this novel deep learning system to learn local, stationary, and compositional features on graphs.},

	abstract = {Combining multiple types of genomic, transcriptional, proteomic, and epigenetic datasets has the potential to reveal biological mechanisms across multiple scales, and may lead to more accurate models for clinical decision support. Developing efficient models that can derive clinical outcomes from high-dimensional data remains problematical; challenges include the integration of multiple types of omics data, inclusion of biological background knowledge, and developing machine learning models that are able to deal with this high dimensionality while having only few samples from which to derive a model. We developed DeepMOCCA, a framework for multi-omics cancer analysis. We combine different types of omics data using biological relations between genes, transcripts, and proteins, combine the multi-omics data with background knowledge in the form of protein{\textendash}protein interaction networks, and use graph convolution neural networks to exploit this combination of multi-omics data and background knowledge. DeepMOCCA predicts survival time for individual patient samples for 33 cancer types and outperforms most existing survival prediction methods. Moreover, DeepMOCCA includes a graph attention mechanism which prioritizes driver genes and prognostic markers in a patient-specific manner; the attention mechanism can be used to identify drivers and prognostic markers within cohorts and individual patients.Author summary Linking the features of tumors to a prognosis for the patient is a critical part of managing cancer. Many methods have been applied to this problem but we still lack accurate prognostic markers for many cancers. We now have more information than ever before on the state of the cancer genome, the epigenetic changes in tumors, and gene expression at both RNA and protein levels. Here, we address the question of how this data can be used to predict cancer survival and discover which tumor genes make the greatest contribution to the prognosis in individual tumor samples. We have developed a computational model, DeepMOCCA, that uses artificial neural networks underpinned by a large graph constructed from background knowledge concerning the functional interactions between genes and their products. We show that with our method, DeepMOCCA can predict cancer survival time based entirely on features of the tumor at a cellular and molecular level. The method confirms many existing genes that affect survival but for some cancers suggests new genes, either not implicated in survival before or not known to be important in that particular cancer. The ability to predict the important features in individual tumors provided by our method raises the possibility of personalized therapy based on the gene or network dominating the prognosis for that patient.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

    abstract = "{Protein function prediction is one of the major tasks of bioinformatics that can help in wide range of biological problems such as understanding disease mechanisms or finding drug targets. Many methods are available for predicting protein functions from sequence based features, protein–protein interaction networks, protein structure or literature. However, other than sequence, most of the features are difficult to obtain or not available for many proteins thereby limiting their scope. Furthermore, the performance of sequence-based function prediction methods is often lower than methods that incorporate multiple features and predicting protein functions may require a lot of time.We developed a novel method for predicting protein functions from sequence alone which combines deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model with sequence similarity based predictions. Our CNN model scans the sequence for motifs which are predictive for protein functions and combines this with functions of similar proteins (if available). We evaluate the performance of DeepGOPlus using the CAFA3 evaluation measures and achieve an Fmax of 0.390, 0.557 and 0.614 for BPO, MFO and CCO evaluations, respectively. These results would have made DeepGOPlus one of the three best predictors in CCO and the second best performing method in the BPO and MFO evaluations. We also compare DeepGOPlus with state-of-the-art methods such as DeepText2GO and GOLabeler on another dataset. DeepGOPlus can annotate around 40 protein sequences per second on common hardware, thereby making fast and accurate function predictions available for a wide range of proteins.http://deepgoplus.bio2vec.net/.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

    abstract = { Functional and evolutionary patterning converges at the level of macroscale cortical structural organization. The topology of the cerebral cortex has been proposed to provide an important source of constraint for the organization of cognition. In a sample of twins (n = 1113), we determined structural covariance of thickness to be organized along both a posterior-to-anterior and an inferior-to-superior axis. Both organizational axes were present when investigating the genetic correlation of cortical thickness, suggesting a strong genetic component in humans, and had a comparable organization in macaques, demonstrating they are phylogenetically conserved in primates. In both species, the inferior-superior dimension of cortical organization aligned with the predictions of dual-origin theory, and in humans, we found that the posterior-to-anterior axis related to a functional topography describing a continuum of functions from basic processes involved in perception and action to more abstract features of human cognition. Together, our study provides important insights into how functional and evolutionary patterns converge at the level of macroscale cortical structural organization. }

	abstract = {A variety of molecular genetic approaches were used to study the effect of rabies virus (RV) infection on host gene expression in mouse brain. The down-regulation of gene expression was found to be a major effect of RV infection by using subtraction hybridization. However, a combination of techniques identified approximately 39 genes activated by infection. These included genes involved in regulation of cell metabolism, protein synthesis, synaptic activity, and cell growth and differentiation. Northern blot analysis to monitor temporal activation of several of these genes following infection revealed essentially two patterns of activation: (i) an early response with up-regulation beginning within 3 days after infection and correlating with transcription of RV nuclear protein; and (ii) a late response with enhanced expression occurring at days 6–7 after infection and associated with peak RV replication. The gene activation patterns and the known functions of their products suggest that a number of host genes may be involved in the replication and spread of RV in the brain.},

Like many gene expression studies, that analysis relied primarily on ad hoc 'fold change' and 'absent/present' criteria to select genes. To determine whether statistically motivated methods would give a more sensitive and selective analysis of gene expression patterns in the brain, we decided to use analysis of variance (ANOVA) and feature selection methods designed to select genes showing strain- or region-dependent patterns of expression.},

	abstract = {A brain atlas is necessary for analyzing structure and function in neuroimaging research. Although various annotation volumes (AVs) for the mouse brain have been proposed, it is common in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the mouse brain that regions-of-interest (ROIs) for brain structures (nodes) are created arbitrarily according to each researcher’s necessity, leading to inconsistent ROIs among studies. One reason for such a situation is the fact that earlier AVs were fixed, i.e. combination and division of nodes were not implemented. This report presents a pipeline for constructing a flexible annotation atlas (FAA) of the mouse brain by leveraging public resources of the Allen Institute for Brain Science on brain structure, gene expression, and axonal projection. A mere two-step procedure with user-specified, text-based information and Python codes constructs FAA with nodes which can be combined or divided objectively while maintaining anatomical hierarchy of brain structures. Four FAAs with total node count of 4, 101, 866, and 1381 were demonstrated. Unique characteristics of FAA realized analysis of resting-state functional connectivity (FC) across the anatomical hierarchy and among cortical layers, which were thin but large brain structures. FAA can improve the consistency of whole brain ROI definition among laboratories by fulfilling various requests from researchers with its flexibility and reproducibility.},
