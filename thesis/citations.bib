abstract = {In this work, we are interested in generalizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) from low-dimensional regular grids, where image, video and speech are represented, to high-dimensional irregular domains, such as social networks, brain connectomes or words' embedding, represented by graphs. We present a formulation of CNNs in the context of spectral graph theory, which provides the necessary mathematical background and efficient numerical schemes to design fast localized convolutional filters on graphs. Importantly, the proposed technique offers the same linear computational complexity and constant learning complexity as classical CNNs, while being universal to any graph structure. Experiments on MNIST and 20NEWS demonstrate the ability of this novel deep learning system to learn local, stationary, and compositional features on graphs.},

	abstract = {Combining multiple types of genomic, transcriptional, proteomic, and epigenetic datasets has the potential to reveal biological mechanisms across multiple scales, and may lead to more accurate models for clinical decision support. Developing efficient models that can derive clinical outcomes from high-dimensional data remains problematical; challenges include the integration of multiple types of omics data, inclusion of biological background knowledge, and developing machine learning models that are able to deal with this high dimensionality while having only few samples from which to derive a model. We developed DeepMOCCA, a framework for multi-omics cancer analysis. We combine different types of omics data using biological relations between genes, transcripts, and proteins, combine the multi-omics data with background knowledge in the form of protein{\textendash}protein interaction networks, and use graph convolution neural networks to exploit this combination of multi-omics data and background knowledge. DeepMOCCA predicts survival time for individual patient samples for 33 cancer types and outperforms most existing survival prediction methods. Moreover, DeepMOCCA includes a graph attention mechanism which prioritizes driver genes and prognostic markers in a patient-specific manner; the attention mechanism can be used to identify drivers and prognostic markers within cohorts and individual patients.Author summary Linking the features of tumors to a prognosis for the patient is a critical part of managing cancer. Many methods have been applied to this problem but we still lack accurate prognostic markers for many cancers. We now have more information than ever before on the state of the cancer genome, the epigenetic changes in tumors, and gene expression at both RNA and protein levels. Here, we address the question of how this data can be used to predict cancer survival and discover which tumor genes make the greatest contribution to the prognosis in individual tumor samples. We have developed a computational model, DeepMOCCA, that uses artificial neural networks underpinned by a large graph constructed from background knowledge concerning the functional interactions between genes and their products. We show that with our method, DeepMOCCA can predict cancer survival time based entirely on features of the tumor at a cellular and molecular level. The method confirms many existing genes that affect survival but for some cancers suggests new genes, either not implicated in survival before or not known to be important in that particular cancer. The ability to predict the important features in individual tumors provided by our method raises the possibility of personalized therapy based on the gene or network dominating the prognosis for that patient.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

    abstract = "{Protein function prediction is one of the major tasks of bioinformatics that can help in wide range of biological problems such as understanding disease mechanisms or finding drug targets. Many methods are available for predicting protein functions from sequence based features, protein–protein interaction networks, protein structure or literature. However, other than sequence, most of the features are difficult to obtain or not available for many proteins thereby limiting their scope. Furthermore, the performance of sequence-based function prediction methods is often lower than methods that incorporate multiple features and predicting protein functions may require a lot of time.We developed a novel method for predicting protein functions from sequence alone which combines deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model with sequence similarity based predictions. Our CNN model scans the sequence for motifs which are predictive for protein functions and combines this with functions of similar proteins (if available). We evaluate the performance of DeepGOPlus using the CAFA3 evaluation measures and achieve an Fmax of 0.390, 0.557 and 0.614 for BPO, MFO and CCO evaluations, respectively. These results would have made DeepGOPlus one of the three best predictors in CCO and the second best performing method in the BPO and MFO evaluations. We also compare DeepGOPlus with state-of-the-art methods such as DeepText2GO and GOLabeler on another dataset. DeepGOPlus can annotate around 40 protein sequences per second on common hardware, thereby making fast and accurate function predictions available for a wide range of proteins.http://deepgoplus.bio2vec.net/.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",
